  <h1>Item #: SCP-1619-T</h1>
  <p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Thaumiel</p>

  <h2>Special Containment Procedures:</h2>
  <p>
    SCP-1619-T does not possess a constant physical form and primarily manifests through digital channels and visual phenomena. No containment method has proven effective so far. All Foundation systems must be equipped with emergency analog redundancy and constant surveillance to detect anomalous visual or behavioral disturbances.
  </p>

  <h2>Description:</h2>
  <p>
    SCP-1619-T is a non-corporeal, presumably sentient entity whose preferred manifestation is a white, humanoid figure approximately five meters in height, with elongated limbs and facial features in an advanced state of decomposition. The entity typically appears in dark environments, often through video recordings, security cameras, or corrupted broadcast signals.
  </p>
  <p>
    SCP-1619-T does not communicate in traditional ways. Its "voice" manifests through electronic distortion, static, and fragmented speech—frequently followed by psychological symptoms in exposed individuals. To date, three personnel have suffered complete mental breakdowns after direct exposure.
  </p>

  <h2>Visual Log:</h2>
  <p>
    The video below was extracted from a terminal compromised by SCP-1619-T. Viewing is recommended only in controlled environments.

  <h2>Additional Manifestation:</h2>
  <p>
    One of the most disturbing reports indicates SCP-1619-T has begun to appear directly inside private residences, following a pattern of digital infiltration. The following video surfaced anonymously with no metadata traceable to its uploader.

  <p><strong>WARNING:</strong> Any unauthorized reproduction or analysis of this footage is strictly prohibited by Foundation directive.</p>

  <blockquote>
    On 20/█2/█0█3, SCP-1619-T was responsible for an unauthorized XK-class end-of-the-world scenario, resulting in the death of approximately 51% of the United States population. The majority of victims exhibited immediate suicidal behavior after visual exposure to SCP-1619-T media.

    To date, no containment attempt has succeeded. The entity remains active and continues to expand its influence. Extreme caution is advised when viewing any related content.
