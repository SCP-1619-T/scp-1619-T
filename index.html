  <h1>Item #: SCP-1619-T</h1>
  <p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Thaumiel</p>

  <h2>Special Containment Procedures:</h2>
  <p>
    SCP-1619-T does not possess a constant physical form and primarily manifests through digital channels and visual phenomena. No containment method has proven effective so far. All Foundation systems must be equipped with emergency analog redundancy and constant surveillance to detect anomalous visual or behavioral disturbances.
  </p>

  <h2>Description:</h2>
  <p>
    SCP-1619-T is a non-corporeal, presumably sentient entity whose preferred manifestation is a white, humanoid figure approximately five meters in height, with elongated limbs and facial features in an advanced state of decomposition. The entity typically appears in dark environments, often through video recordings, security cameras, or corrupted broadcast signals.
  </p>
  <p>
    SCP-1619-T does not communicate in traditional ways. Its "voice" manifests through electronic distortion, static, and fragmented speechâ€”frequently followed by psychological symptoms in exposed individuals. To date, three personnel have suffered complete mental breakdowns after direct exposure.
